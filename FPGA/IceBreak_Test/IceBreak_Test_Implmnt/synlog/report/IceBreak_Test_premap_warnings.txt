@W: MT531 :"c:\users\birdman\documents\dirtbaglabsupplies\dmm\dmm_trunk\fpga\icebreak_test\ftdi_fifo\ftdi_input_simple.v":89:1:89:2|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 10 sequential elements including fifo_inst.ftdi_input_inst.rPacketCount[3:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
